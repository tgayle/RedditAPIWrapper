This project will be developed as an entirely new and standalone project in the Kotlin programming language. In the first sprint of the project, basic interactions with the Reddit API will be implemented, including loading posts from the “front page,” posts from specific subreddits, and the comments associated with individual posts. In the second sprint of the application, integration with user accounts will be implemented, enabling users to view their generated front page from Reddit, and allowing users to create comments and vote on other posts.

This library serves as a wrapper around [Reddit](https://reddit.com), a internet forum.
